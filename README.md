## 🚀 Running Locally

**⚠️ Important:** This project requires a live server to run properly. Opening `index.html` directly in a browser (using `file://` protocol) will not work due to CORS restrictions when loading `data.json`.

### Option 1: VS Code Live Server (Recommended)
1. Install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VS Code
2. Right-click on `index.html`
3. Select "Open with Live Server"

### Option 2: Python HTTP Server
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### Option 3: Node.js http-server
```bash
npx http-server -p 8000
```
Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### Option 4: GitHub Pages (Production)
The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when pushed to the main branch. See the repository's Pages settings for the live URL.
